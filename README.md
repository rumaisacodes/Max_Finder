Simple Max Finder
A lightweight Python utility designed to quickly compare two integers and output the larger of the two. This is a perfect example of clean, readable Python logic using ternary operators.

🚀 Features
User Interaction: Prompts for two separate integer inputs.
Concise Logic: Uses a single-line conditional expression for the comparison.
Error-Free: Fixed variable case-sensitivity for seamless execution.

🛠️ How It Works
The script uses the following logic to determine the result:
It captures two inputs from the terminal.
It converts those inputs into integers (using int()).
It evaluates the expression: a if a > b else b.

📋 Usage
Ensure you have Python 3.x installed.
Clone this repository:

Bash
